# MSFS Auto Start

MSFS Auto Start gives you a GUI for the built-in EXE.xml file in MSFS.

## Installation

Unzip the folder and run the portable application anywhere on your PC. It does not need to stay open while MSFS runs.

## Usage

You must set your MSFS community folder location before the program will work. Once it is set, if you already have anything auto-starting with MSFS, you will see it automatically listed. You can add any exe on your PC to be autostarted with the sim. There is an options menu for each executable, allowing you to enable or disable auto-start as well as input custom command-line arguments to be used upon program startup.

The global setting menu, located at the top left, allows you to set your community folder location and enable or disable auto-start. This acts as a master toggle and **MUST** be on for auto-start to work for any executable listed.

## Bugs
Please submit any bugs you encounter on the [GitHub](https://github.com/Matti8u/MSFSAutoStart) issues page.
## Roadmap
Allow automatic closing of applications once MSFS closes. Currently working on it, but as there is no native way to do this, it is proving more challenging. Expect v2.0 within about a week.

**Note regarding open source:** Although this is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Matti8u/MSFSAutoStart), I am by no means a professional programmer, especially when it comes to Windows apps. Therefore, by trying to read and comprehend my code, you acknowledge that you may experience symptoms including, but not limited to: Headache; Nausea; Dizziness; or Fatigue. (In all seriousness, the code is quite messy, you have been warned.)
